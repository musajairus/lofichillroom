Lo-Fi Chillroom is a single-page music web app where users can explore a curated playlist of lo-fi tracks. The app provides song previews, allows users to favorite tracks, and includes a dark/light mode for a chill browsing vibe. Itâ€™s meant to be simple yet engaging, like a pocket-sized Spotify, focused entirely on lo-fi music.
